In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a 
symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol
and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.

Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. What is the sum of all of the part 
numbers in the engine schematic?
