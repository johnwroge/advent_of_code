'''
As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the 
numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card
 worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.


Card 1: 
'41 48 83 86 17','83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53'
