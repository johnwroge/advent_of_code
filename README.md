Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge created by Eric Wastl. Each day from December 1-25, a new two-part puzzle is released at midnight EST. The puzzles progress in difficulty and can be solved using any programming language.
These are my solutions to the select puzzles from 2022, 2023, and 2024, implemented in Python/Java/TypeScript/Go.
